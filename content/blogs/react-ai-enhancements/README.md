# React AI Enhancements Example

This demonstrates how to use Froala, Filestack, and React to perform red eye removal and image tagging. Red eye removal deals with fixing the red eye effect from taking photos with flash in dark settings. Image tagging generates tags to identify and analyze an image's features.

---

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload images using the integrated Filestack API in the Froala WYSIWYG editor.
- **Red Eye Removal**: Remove the red eye effect from uploaded images.
- **AI Image Tagging**: Fetch and display tags with confidence scores for recognized objects.

---

## Prerequisites

To run this example, you will need:

1. A valid **Filestack API Key**.
2. A **policy** and **signature** for secure API calls.
   - These can be generated from your [Filestack Dashboard](https://www.filestack.com/).

---

## How to Run

### 1. Create a React application:   

- Install Froala using: `npm install react-froala-wysiwyg`
 
### 2. Download the necessary files

- Paste the "components" folder and the "App.js" file into your "src" folder.
- Replace the placeholders for the Filestack API key, policy, and signature.

### 3. Run the application

Type in `npm start` in your CLI.

---

### How It Works

1. Click the **"Filestack icon"**.
2. Select an image to upload (preferably one with an apparent red eye effect).
3. Upload the image and wait for the application to insert the enhanced image into the editor.
4. Tags generated by the Filestack AI API will appear **below the image** with their confidence scores.

### Notes

- Ensure your Filestack **API Key**, **policy**, and **signature** are valid.
- For production, review security settings, keep keys private and on your server, and ensure proper optimization.

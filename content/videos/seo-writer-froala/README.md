# Extending Froala with Custom AI Actions

This repository showcases a technical demonstration of how to extend the Froala editor by building custom AI actions directly into its inline toolbar. The project integrates the Deepseek AI to create a sophisticated, context-aware writing and editing tool.

## Features

* **Custom Toolbar Button** : Adds a new, custom button to the Froala editor's toolbar.
* **AI Integration** : Makes API requests to the Deepseek AI with the selected text from the editor.
* **Seamless Editing Experience** : Inserts the AI-generated response directly back into the document, enhancing the user's workflow.
* **Advanced In-Editor Utilities** : Provides a framework for building tools that can analyze content against specific criteria, such as Google's E-E-A-T guidelines, without leaving the editor.

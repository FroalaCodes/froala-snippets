# Froala Find & Replace Plugin Demo

This repository contains a self-contained, interactive demo for the  **Froala WYSIWYG Editor's Find & Replace plugin** . It allows you to explore the plugin's methods, events, and configuration options in a live environment without any setup.

This repository contains all the code snippets from our video post, [How to Use The Froala Find and Replace Plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2dQIVmDOAY).

## Features ‚ú®

* **Interactive Method Testing** : Use dedicated controls to call plugin methods like `findMatches()`, `replaceMatch()`, and `showPopup()`.
* **Dynamic Configuration** : Apply and test configuration options such as `enableMatchCase` and `enableMatchWholeWord` by re-initializing the editor on the fly.
* **Live Event Logging** : An event console logs plugin events (`onReplace`, `beforeClose`, etc.) in real-time as you interact with the editor.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases** : The editor is pre-loaded with text designed to test various search scenarios, including case-sensitive and whole-word matching.
* **Zero Setup Required** : Runs directly in any modern browser from a single HTML file with no need for a local server or build process.

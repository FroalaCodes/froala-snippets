# Angular Image Tagging Example

This repository uses Froala, Filestack, and Angular 19 to extract descriptive tags from an image. These tags are key-value pairs (label and confidence score, e.g., 'person: 99') that correspond to an image's overall features. 

---

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload images using the Filestack API in the Froala editor.
- **AI Image Tagging**: Fetch and display tags with confidence scores for recognized objects.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive layout with organized results.

---

## Prerequisites

To run this example, you will need:

1. A valid **Filestack API Key**.
2. A **policy** and **signature** for secure API calls.
   - These can be generated from your [Filestack Dashboard](https://www.filestack.com/).

---

## How to Run

### 1. Create an Angular application:   

- Install Froala using: `npm install angular-froala-wysiwyg`
 
### 2. Download the necessary files

- Clone this repository into your project folder.
- Replace the placeholders for the Filestack API key, policy, and signature in your `editor.component.ts` file.

### 3. Run the application

Type in `ng serve` in your CLI.

---

### How It Works

1. Click the **"Filestack icon"**.
2. Select an image to upload.
3. Tags generated by the Filestack AI API will appear **below the image** with their confidence scores.

### Notes

- Ensure your Filestack **API Key**, **policy**, and **signature** are valid.
- For production, review security settings, keep keys private and on your server, and ensure proper optimization.
